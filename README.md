# ByersPringle_InteractiveVisualization

Interactive visualizations for a submitted manuscript by James E. Byers and James M. Pringle can be found [here](https://jamiepringle.github.io/ByersPringle_InteractiveVisualization/). Information on the manuscript will be posted when the manuscript has completed the review process. 

Instructions on how to manipulate the interactive graphics can be found in [this youTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB_xS-Kv5_k&t=2s).

The code to download the Lagrangian paths from the EZfate project and calculate the statics shown in the manuscript, is provided in the directory `CodeFor_ByersPringle`. This code will generate all the statistics given in the paper in CSV files organized by latitude and longitude which can be plotted using the readers prefered tools. 

Upon publication, we will register this site with Zenodo and create a stable DOI.
